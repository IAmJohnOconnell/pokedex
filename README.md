## Lessons Learned

Building this gave me a lot of confidence working with API's
and asynchronus code. It was a fun way to re-enforce what I knew about error handling and
different methods of form validation.

The PokeAPI has a lot of deeply nested data that required some finesse to access and format the way I wanted.
